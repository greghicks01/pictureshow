# Picture Show 

Picture show is inspired by a product produced by Fluke Corpotation for thei MET/CAL product before they moved to a web aplpication.

## Usage
The program is a single form that allows a user to browse the images in a folder nominated by the METCAL.ini file on the local drive.

It needs a little TLC after first creating this in 2005 for an evening project.
